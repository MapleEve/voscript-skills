One command to install. Any AI agent (Claude Code, Trae, Cursor…) immediately knows how to drive VoScript.<br>
Full workflow coverage: submit audio, poll jobs, export subtitles, manage voiceprints.<br>
Pure Python + requests. Zero extra dependencies.

## Sound familiar?

> You deployed VoScript. You're using an AI agent to automate tasks. But to make the agent submit a recording, wait for results, and export subtitles, you'd need to write a pile of glue code first.

> Or: the agent hit the API, but didn't know which endpoint to call, when the job would finish, or why `speaker_label` and the display name are different things.

This skill package fixes that. **Load once, and the agent knows the full VoScript workflow.**

---

## Installation

### Option 1: npx (recommended)

```bash
npx voscript-skills
```

Installs to `~/.claude/skills/voscript-api/` by default. Claude Code picks it up automatically.

**Install for all detected agents at once:**

```bash
npx voscript-skills --all
```

**Specify an agent or directory:**

```bash
npx voscript-skills --agent trae      # claude / trae / cursor / codex / gemini / hermes / openclaw / windsurf / cline / roo / codebuddy / qwen
npx voscript-skills --dir /custom/skills/path
```

**Uninstall:**

```bash
npx voscript-skills --uninstall
```

### Option 2: Git clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MapleEve/voscript-skills.git ~/.claude/skills/
```

After cloning, `~/.claude/skills/voscript-api/` is the skill directory.

## What you get

**11 ready-to-run scripts covering the full workflow**

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `submit_audio.py` | Submit an audio file, get a job ID |
| `poll_job.py` | Progress-bar polling, waits until complete |
| `fetch_result.py` | Fetch complete transcript (with speaker names) |
| `export_transcript.py` | Export SRT / TXT / JSON |
| `list_transcriptions.py` | List all transcription records |
| `enroll_voiceprint.py` | Enroll a voiceprint (with speaker_label guard) |
| `list_voiceprints.py` | List enrolled voiceprints |
| `assign_speaker.py` | Manually assign a segment's speaker |
| `manage_voiceprint.py` | View / rename / delete voiceprints |
| `rebuild_cohort.py` | Rebuild AS-norm cohort |
| `common.py` | Base client + diagnostic helpers |

Every script outputs a structured failure report on error — so the agent knows exactly what went wrong and how to fix it.

## VoScript Compatibility

This package tracks VoScript `v0.7.2` behavior: architecture foundation and stability hardening. The public workflow remains submit → poll → fetch/export → manage voiceprints. It also documents in-flight dedup polling, persisted AS-norm cohort rebuilds, unbounded AS-norm scores, and the new-voice AS-norm validation pattern.

It does not promise provider preset/API selection, streaming sessions, or full speaker memory as completed features; those remain future-version work.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip install requests`
- A running [VoScript server](https://github.com/MapleEve/VoScript)

### Configuration

```bash
export VOSCRIPT_URL=http://localhost:8780
export VOSCRIPT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or pass `--url` / `--api-key` directly to each script.

### Examples

```bash
# Submit audio
python voscript-api/scripts/submit_audio.py --file meeting.mp3

# Poll until complete
python voscript-api/scripts/poll_job.py --job-id tr_xxxxxxxx

# Get result
python voscript-api/scripts/fetch_result.py --tr-id tr_xxxxxxxx

# Export SRT
python voscript-api/scripts/export_transcript.py --tr-id tr_xxxxxxxx --format srt

# Enroll voiceprint (use speaker_label, NOT display name!)
python voscript-api/scripts/enroll_voiceprint.py \
  --tr-id tr_xxxxxxxx \
  --speaker-label SPEAKER_00 \
  --speaker-name "John"
```

## Loading in an AI Agent

Install to your agent's skills directory, then load `voscript-api/SKILL.md`. The agent reads the workflow definitions and script usage automatically — no extra configuration needed.
